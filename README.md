In this toy-example, I demonstrate how to run NVidia StyleGAN2 ADA inside a Google CoLab notebook for the purpose of generating human faces. 
The notebook allows you to record a video in which people's faces smoothly change from frame to frame. 
This is done by a smooth transition from some initial vector to some final one in the hidden space of face embeddings. GPU is assumed.The result is shown in the faces_movie.mp4 file.
